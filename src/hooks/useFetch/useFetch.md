## Exercise: Create a `useFetch` React Hook

### Objective
The goal of this exercise is to create a custom React hook named `useFetch` that will make it easier to fetch data from APIs in your React components.

### Parameters

- **url (`string`)**: The URL from which data needs to be fetched.
- **options (`RequestInit`)**: An optional object that allows you to control various settings of the fetch request (e.g., method, headers).

### Return Values

- **data (`any`)**: The data retrieved from the API. This will be `null` if the data is not yet fetched.
- **loading (`boolean`)**: Indicates whether the data is currently being fetched.
- **error (`Error | null`)**: An Error object if the fetch fails, otherwise `null`.

### Guidelines

1. **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript to enforce types on the parameters, return values, and inside the hook. This will make the code more robust.
  
2. **React Hooks**: Utilize React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage state and side-effects.
  
3. **Fetch API**: Use JavaScript's native `fetch` API to handle the HTTP request.

4. **Loading State**: The hook should maintain a loading state that indicates whether data is being fetched.

5. **Error Handling**: The hook should be capable of catching and returning errors if the fetch operation fails.

### Example Usage

Your hook should be usable in the following manner:

```typescript
const { data, loading, error } = useFetch("https://api.example.com/items");
```

### Bonus Points
1. Add JSDoc comments to describe the function, parameters, and return values.
2. Write unit tests to validate your hook's functionality.
3. Allow the hook to refetch data based on some trigger or condition.
